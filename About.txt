The Customer Effectiveness Score (CES) is a comprehensive metric that measures how successfully a business meets and exceeds customer expectations across multiple touchpoints.
This score combines key performance indicators including customer satisfaction ratings, response times, resolution rates, and repeat engagement patterns.
Operating on a scale of 0-100, it provides organizations with actionable insights into their customer service quality and operational efficiency.
A score above 75 typically indicates strong customer satisfaction and effective service delivery, while scores below 50 suggest immediate areas for improvement.
By tracking CES over time, businesses can identify trends, optimize their customer service strategies, and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experiences.
